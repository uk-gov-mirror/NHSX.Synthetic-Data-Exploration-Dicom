# Synthetic Data Exploration: 
## ADicom

**Keywords:** Synthetic, Imaging, Graph

**Need:** Medical imaging data analysis is still only reaching a low amount of its potential opportunity.  This is largely due to the image collections having large amounts of variation in both the images themselves (e.g. different machines having different angles and contrasts) and the tagging of the images (dicom data).  This project would aim to support infrastructure and software development by creating realistic looking dummy dicom data which encompasses the array of messiness and issues faced in reality.

**Current Knowledge/Examples & Possible Techniques/Approaches:** HicServices/BadMedicine.Dicom: CLI / Library for generating dicom files for use in testing applications. Images generated have 'realistic' tag data (based on aggregated tag data in dicom images taken in Scotland) - A project from the health informatics centre at the university of dundee.  

**Related Previous Internship Projects:** n/a as first year of the scheme 

**Enables Future Work:** Training data for imaging machine learning

**Outcome/Learning Objectives:** Module to support or run alongside the BadMedicine repo.

**Datasets:** tbc

**Desired skill set:** When applying please highlight any experience around work with imaging or dicom data and specifically medical imaging data, tagging, probability & graph models, coding experience (including any coding in the open), any other data science experience you feel relevant.
